ML Models Repository

Welcome to the ML Models Repository, a collection of machine learning projects aimed at solving real-world problems. Each project includes code, datasets, and explanations to help you understand and implement these models effectively.

# Projects Included

### 1. Heart Disease Prediction

Description: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on 14 parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

Algorithm Used: RandomForest Classifier (can be extended with other algorithms).

Dataset: Publicly available heart disease dataset.

# Key Features:

Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling.

Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 2. Bulldozer Price Prediction

Description: Predicts the resale price of bulldozers using historical data and various features.

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Regression.

Dataset: Public dataset from Kaggle.

# Key Features:

Feature engineering and handling time-series data.

Model evaluation using RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error).

## Future Plans

This repository will be continuously updated with new models and projects. Upcoming additions include:

Dog Breed Identification

More advanced models and techniques for existing projects.
